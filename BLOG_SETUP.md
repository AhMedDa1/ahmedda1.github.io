# Blog Comments & Likes Persistence Setup

This blog system uses GitHub Issues API for persistent storage of comments and likes across sessions.

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Blog Comments Token"
4. Select these scopes:
   - `public_repo` (to create issues in your public repository)
   - `write:discussion` (for discussion features)
5. Copy the generated token

### 2. Configure the Blog System

Open your blog in a browser and run this in the console:

```javascript
// Set your GitHub token for persistence
setGitHubToken('your_github_token_here');
```

### 3. How It Works

- **Comments**: Stored as GitHub Issues with label `blog-data` and `comments`
- **Likes**: Stored as GitHub Issues with label `blog-data` and `likes`
- **Local Fallback**: If no token is set, data is stored locally only
- **Auto-sync**: Data is automatically saved to GitHub on each action

### 4. Data Structure

#### Comments Issue Format:
```
Title: Comments: transformer-architecture
Labels: blog-data, comments

```json

```
